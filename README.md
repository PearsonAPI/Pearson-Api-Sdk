A Javascript Client Library for the Pearson API. (requires jQuery)
===================================================================

### Setting up API and client details.
Make sure you have included jQuery and pearson_sdk.js

### APIs
See the individual API documentation (TravelAPI,DicitonaryAPI) to see how to use the Pearson API SDK for specific APIs.

### Searching
Searching is fundamental to making the most of the Pearson APIs. See the SEARCHING documentation for hints on how to search for content and make the best use of the available search options.

###
Support for IE8/9  
If you wish to support IE8/9 please include the jquery.xdomainrequest.min.js file located in the lib folder. This gets around the fact jQuery doesn't support IE's XDomainRequest object.

### Historic
The file sdk.js is a historic version of the Pearson API SDK, and is now considered depricated. Please use pearson_sdk.js instead.
